# adapt-contrib-textNotify

This component is basically a contrib-text which hijacks any anchor tag clicks in the bodyText (`component-body`), and shows a notify popup instead of navigating to the href.

---

**IMPORTANT NOTES**:
- This component is dependant on [this commit](https://github.com/taylortom/adapt_framework/commit/a7af2e3f8713979f3b8933ed6c443f254ec6eb27) to the core framework which is yet to be merged.
- Requires adapt-contrib-text to be installed.**

## Limitations
 
<p><strong>DOES NOT WORK WITH FRAMEWORK VERSION 5</strong>. Please go to the Framework 5 version of this component on my other github site...</p>
